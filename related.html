<p>We are the Yeager family and you may know us from our channel on Youtube called Shot of The Yeagers. There are a total of 8 of us Yeagers! We have 6 kids, 5 girls and I boy. You can learn about each one of our children on their individual pages on this website! Check them out! We of course, think they are pretty awesome! We are a vlogging family.</p>
<p>We love to video all of our adventures every day! We started vlogging in August of 2015, and let me tell you it has been a fun and amazing journey. Of course it has also been a lot of hard work and dedication. Our very first video ever posted was of us putting the kids to work. Wow, that video feels like it was a lifetime ago! We currently have made over 1,000 videos.</p>
<p>We have learned so much and have had so much fun in the process of making all those videos! As of now, we have more than 3 million subscribers! That just blows us away!! We have enjoyed celebrating with our fans over the past 3 years. On our Youtube channel, Shot of the Yeagers we have celebrations for hitting different subscribers milestones!
